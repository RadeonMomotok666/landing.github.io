                        We understand all the details of commercial-freight hauling, providing a broad view of the task and making the process as simple as possible. We can process permits for freight traffic across the USA and provide you with a full set of all accompanying
                        documents. We are ready to create permits for a wide selection of vehicles, so overweight transportation is not a problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We issue DOT permits, but pricing will differ depending on the state, load, and route for which the permit is issued. We accept all major credit cards. Our service fee is $20.

                    <li>
                        Depending on the DOT, permit processing can take one to seven days after receiving all necessary information. After the permit is issued, you will receive it by email or fax.
